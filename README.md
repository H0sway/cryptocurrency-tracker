# WDI Project Two

**Build a web-based, CRUD application.**

## Objectives

### Build confidence as a developer by building something of your own.

-  Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of 
unstructured work.
-  Gain experience building a complex application.
-  Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate 
manner.
-  Learn new technologies by reading documentation and experimenting.

## Requirements

- A full CRUD app, with create, edit, and delete functionality
- MVC-style models, views, and controllers
- A functioning database with at least two tables
- An external API call using fetch from the front-end
- Interactivity in the front end (microinteractions, DOM manipulation, etc.)
- Wireframes & user stories
- A thorough README file that contains the following:
    - Why you chose to build this app
    - The technologies you used and a description of how you used them
    - A code snippet of a part of the app you're particularly proud of
    - Any things you plan to fix or features you plan to add
- Here are a couple of example projects: [Forum](forum.md), [Wiki](wiki.md)

### Technological Requirements

You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project:

- **HTML / EJS**: Your HTML should be semantic and valid.
- **Node and Express**: Your app will need to have its own server.
- **SQL / PG-PROMISE**: Your app will need to persist data.
- **FETCH**: Your app will need to make an API call from the front-end.

Once you've got the server side MVP established, you should turn some attention to the client side.

- **CSS & Design**: Your app should be pleasing to look at. Your design should take usability into account.
- **JavaScript & jQuery** Your app should have some interactivity

## Process

Resist the urge to jump immediately into coding.  For this sprint we want to 
carefully plan our approach.

- Database - draw out the tables & columns you plan to use in your database.
- Wireframes - detail the flow of your app through simple wireframes
  * You can choose whether you want to whiteboard the wireframes or use some program.
- Routes - design the HTTP route architecture of your app
- Set up a github repo and project board for your project
- Find an API that you plan on using and test it out

## Timeline

* *Start Planning* - 5:00PM on Monday, May 1 - Choose a project and begin planning
* *Project Approvals* - 10:00 AM on Tuesday, May 2 - Wireframes, user stories, database structure.
* *First Check-in* - with squad leader on Wednesday, May 3 - Project board, which API you plan to use.
* *Second Check-in* - 12:00PM on Friday, May 5 - Git repo, routes structure, initial Heroku deployment.
* *Stand Ups* - Every day with your squad leader
* *Presentations* - 10:00AM on Monday, May 7

## Deliverables

* Public repo on Github with your project code
* `README.md` (in the root folder of your project) that includes:
  * The project's name and description
  * Your feature spec with links to pictures of your wireframes
  * APIs or modules used and descriptions of each
  * Instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost
* A 5-minute lightning talk that:
  * Is 5 minutes in length
  * Shows off all features of the app
  * Explains the technical details
  * Explains the technical challenges
  * Explains which improvements you might make

## Instructional help
In a push for developer indepedence and self-reliance, we are going to adhere to
[these rules](https://git.generalassemb.ly/gist/bobbyking/3b7e8d65205a6a0580559cd304e1ce84) 
for recieving help during this project.

## Keep in Mind

**You are going to encounter a ton of unexpected errors and problems.**

Expect to come up against a lot of what can *seem* like roadblocks. Resist the urge to get frustrated. These are amazing learning opportunities. A lot of students treat errors during projects as just getting in the way of "finishing". The point of this project is **not** to finish everything; the point is to integrate your knowledge and deepen your understanding of how to put apps together.

Errors often provide the most valuable source of information about what we don't yet understand. Seeing an error as "it's not working" and randomly changing code until "it works" won't teach you anything. Spending time thoughtfully debugging issues is a fantastic investment that will lead to greater mastery and understanding.

**Pro-Tip** - 'Failure is a temporary state.' :v:

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes as specified above? Did you use source control (Git) as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)? Did you submit your project via an issue ticket on GHE?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using Heroku?

* __Presentation__: Did you present your app, your code, and your project-making experience clearly and effectively to the class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a score for each section between:

| Score          | Expectations   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| **0**          | _Incomplete._  |
| **1**          | _Does not meet expectations._ |
| **2**          | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3**          | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

### A Note on Plagiarism

Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for expulsion. Our entire policy can be found [in the wiki](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-nyc-purple-rain-students/wiki/General-Assembly-Plagiarism-Policy).

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
* Turning in work that is not your own.
* Turning in someone else's work as your own.
* Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
* Copying words or code without giving credit.
* Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
* Giving incorrect information about a source.
* Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
* Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
* Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
